Team Name: Chess Masters

Team Members: Kenny Lau, Timothy Sit

Project Description: This is just regular chess. There's an 8 by 8 board with all the pieces. The looks will be simplified though with a birds eye view. The pieces will look like simple sprites.

## Development Log
### 5/24/21
**Kenny Lau:** I created the main Processing file, Chess.pde, that draws an 8x8 chess board on a 800x800 screen in Processing. I also created the ```Square``` class that "lights up" the board when pieces are selected by drawing rectangles at the correct location. We also complete the ```Piece``` abstract class (so far, we may need to update it for functions we will implement later, such as rotating the board). The ```Pawn``` class was also created with skeleton code (abstract classes are stated but not implemented, so it can still be compiled).
